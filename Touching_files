# Module 3: Comprehending Commands

## Touching files
Of course, you can also create files! There are several ways to do this, but we'll look at a simple command here. You can create a new, blank file by touching it with the touch command:

hacker@dojo:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ touch pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$ ls
pwnfile
hacker@dojo:/tmp$
It's that simple! In this level, please create two files: /tmp/pwn and /tmp/college, and run /challenge/run to get your flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kO1xYxmsJAHthkdAeTMRmpkev9c.QXwMDO0wiNyUDN0EzW}`

Changed directory to '/tmp', then used the touch command to create files pwn and college, then listed the directory to check if the files have been added or not and ran /challenge/run to get the flag.

```bash
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ cd /tmp
hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ touch pwn college
hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ ls
bin      dbus-AALUBwpQay  pwn               tmp.2dyEZcT2Od
college  hsperfdata_root  ssh-XXXXXXcCMluL
hacker@commands~touching-files:/tmp$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{kO1xYxmsJAHthkdAeTMRmpkev9c.QXwMDO0wiNyUDN0EzW}
```
