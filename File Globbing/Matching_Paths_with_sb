# Module 5: File Globbing

## Matching paths with []
Globbing happens on a path basis, so you can expand entire paths with your globbed arguments. For example:

hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: /home/hacker/file_[ab]
Look: /home/hacker/file_a /home/hacker/file_b
Now it's your turn. Once more, we've placed a bunch of files in /challenge/files. Starting from your home directory, run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into the absolute paths to the file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h files!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0op9QTpqpyF-VdbOO4mmZkuUhhe.QXzIDO0wiNyUDN0EzW}`

This challenge was solved by using bracket globbing within an absolute path. The pattern /challenge/files/file_[bash] expanded to the exact required files, and passing this single expanded argument to /challenge/run successfully revealed the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash] 
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{8rVodortH-yaWWspAIufUIxY5Fz.QX0IDO0wiNyUDN0EzW}
```

### New Learnings
Learned that globbing applies to entire paths, not just filenames, allowing bracket expressions to be used inside absolute paths. This reinforced how [] can precisely control which path components are expanded during shell globbing.
