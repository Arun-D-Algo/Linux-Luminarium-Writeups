## Command History 
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{40lmFDCIQqPVdYxjqyunR189IY8.0lNzEzNxwiNyUDN0EzW}`

Used the up arrow to get the command history storing the flag.

```bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{40lmFDCIQqPVdYxjqyunR189IY8.0lNzEzNxwiNyUDN0EzW}
```

### New Learnings
Learnt that the history of commands can be accessed by using the up and down arrow keys.
