## Killing Misbehaving Processes
Sometimes, misbehaving processes can interfere with your work. These processes might need to be killed...

In this challenge, there's a decoy process that's hogging a critical resource - a named pipe (FIFO) at /tmp/flag_fifo into which (like in the Practicing Piping FIFO challenge) /challenge/run wants to write your flag. You need to kill this process.

Your general workflow should be:

Check what processes are running.
Find /challenge/decoy in the list and figure out its process ID.
kill it.
Run /challenge/run to get the flag without being overwhelmed by decoys (you don't need to redirect its output; it'll write to the FIFO on its own).
Good luck!

NOTE: You might see a few decoy flags show up even after killing the decoy process. This happens because Linux pipes are buffered: conceptually, they have a sort of length through which data flows, and you might kill the decoy process while data is in the pipe. That data, having already entered the pipe, will proceed to the other end (your cat). If you wait a second, you'll see the decoys stop, and then you can /challenge/run and win!


### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sNarpai3srNi22WVzhDr8D7D96N.QXzQDO0wiNyUDN0EzW}`

This challenge centered on interrupting a running process directly from the terminal instead of killing it from another session. When /challenge/run was executed, it deliberately waited and refused to provide the flag until it was interrupted. Pressing Ctrl-C sent an interrupt signal (SIGINT) from the terminal to the running foreground process, causing it to exit immediately. Once interrupted, the program acknowledged the signal and revealed the flag. The task demonstrated how terminals communicate control signals to active programs.

```bash
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sNarpai3srNi22WVzhDr8D7D96N.QXzQDO0wiNyUDN0EzW}
```

### New Learnings
Learned that Ctrl-C sends a SIGINT signal to the foreground process attached to the terminal, allowing it to terminate cleanly without using the kill command. Reinforced the difference between manually killing a process by PID and interrupting the currently running process directly through terminal control signals. Also strengthened understanding of how the terminal manages foreground jobs and how user input can directly influence process execution.
